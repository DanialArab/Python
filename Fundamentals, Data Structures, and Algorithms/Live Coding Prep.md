Some tips:
- Always begin by asking clarifying questions about the prompt.
- Talk through your approach before codingâ€”outline candidate solutions and tradeoffs. Recruiters expect clear thinking, not just correct code
- After coding, walk through test cases, including edge and corner cases. If bugs emerge, debug them live and explain why they occurred and how you fix them
- Discuss time/space complexity and mention tradeoffs (e.g. readability vs performance) to showcase awareness.
