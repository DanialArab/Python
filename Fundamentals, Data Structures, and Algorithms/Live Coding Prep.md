My Plan:
- Take a look at the DS and Algo course and have a plan
- have a plan for daily coding practice from Leetcode and Neetcode



Some tips:
- Always begin by asking clarifying questions about the prompt.
- Talk through your approach before coding—outline candidate solutions and tradeoffs. Recruiters expect clear thinking, not just correct code
- After coding, walk through test cases, including edge and corner cases. If bugs emerge, debug them live and explain why they occurred and how you fix them
   - If your code fails a test case: just calmly add a print, inspect the logic, and explain the fix
   - You can say something like: “Let’s try a few test cases before I run this. For input [2, 3, 3, 2, 4], I expect output 4, because it’s the only non-repeating number.” and “Edge case: empty list → should return None or -1, depending on the requirement.”
- Discuss time/space complexity and mention tradeoffs (e.g. readability vs performance) to showcase awareness.
