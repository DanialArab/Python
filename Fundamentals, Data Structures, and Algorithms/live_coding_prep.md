Some points learbed from the above reference:

- variables are dynamically typed
- arrays are called list in python
- custom sort like arr=['bbb', 'alice', 'jane'] then arr.sort(key=lambda x: len(x))
- from collections import deque 
- HashSet: mySet = set()
- HashMap or dict: myMap = {} 
- import heapq:   heaps are good for finding min and max of a set of values frequently , under the hood they are arrays 
- nested functions
- nonlocal value
