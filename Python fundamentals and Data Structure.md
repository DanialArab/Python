Zip Function

If we have two lists and we want to combine them as a list of tuples let’s say, here we cannot use map function or list comprehension because they both work with a single list and so here we need built-in zip function, which returns a zip object which is also iterable and can be converted to a list like:

    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [10, 20, 30]

    print(list(zip(list1, list2)))


the output would be:

    [(1, 10), (2, 20), (3, 30)]

Something cool would be:

    list1 = [1, 2, 3]
    list2 = [10, 20, 30]

    print(list(zip("abc", list1, list2)))


the output would be:

    [('a', 1, 10), ('b', 2, 20), ('c', 3, 30)]
